        Leslie Mercier, known as "Bubbles or Bubs" out on the trail, 
        first acquired his passion for hiking in late 2016. 
        It all started with a few easy trails in Maine, hiking the Kennebec Highlands, 
        and Camden State Park doing day hikes and with this new found love for the outdoors, 
        he soon itched for overnight hikes. It should be noted that the last bit of real camping Bubs had ever done was during his childhood, 
        and this usually took place in campgrounds or atop Bald Mountain in a camper. After the winter had passed, 
        and having acquired the cheapest set of camping gear possible, Bubs set out for his first true overnight backpacking experience in the wilderness, 
        on the top of Tumbledown Mountain. Though the journey proved to be both peaceful and frightening at times and most certainly tiring, 
        the sights Bubs had set his eyes on that trip would begin the journey of a lifetime... One he could call his own.
